          <h1>Photography & Society</h1>
          <p>Photography opened a whole new dimension of communication for people of the 19th century. With photography procedures being cheaper and more accurate than ever before, much more research was devoted to the subject. In the late 70’s, a dry collodion process was developed that rivaled wet collodion processes in speed and accuracy. It was at about this time that the richer families would pay for family portraits and photos to remember relatives by. In particular photos of the deceased were cherished, as well as those of presidents.</p>
			<p>At this time, photos in newspapers were an isolated occurrence. This changed in the 1870’s, when journalist Adolphe Smith began publishing a magazine “Street Life in London”. This magazine used photos as the main medium of conveying information.</p>

			<h3>How the Other Half Lives</h3>
          <p>In the 1880’s when flash powder was developed, it became possible to take pictures of people indoors and in other low light environments. This development led to the work of “How the Other Half Lives” by Jacob Riis. It documented the terrible living conditions in the New York slums, and strived to raise awareness of these terrible conditions to the higher and middle class citizens. This work not only described how people lived through pictures, but also told of how they lived that way as the result of greed from wealthier people. In this work he even describes the correlation between alcoholism, crime rate, and lack of money. </p>
			
			<p>With this work made with the camera as the most Prominent tool, the city tore down sweatshops, reformed the city’s schools, and performed decades of improvement. If these photographs weren’t around, and the cameras not around to take them, New York would probably even less hospitable than many know it to be today. </p>

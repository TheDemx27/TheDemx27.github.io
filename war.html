          <h1>Photography & the War</h1>
          <p>As pictures became clearer and imaging techniques became cheaper, photographers used this newfound technology to document the war. Many photographers would prepare, expose, and develop the slides in a matter of minutes using the collodion imaging system. Of all wars, the civil war was the first to have extensive image documentation, and so it was the first one could study the effects of it.
			  
			  <div class = "featurette-divider"></div>
			
		  <p>Photography influenced the war mainly through the press. With photography about, normal civilians would not just hear about the dreadful carnage of the war, but see it as well. This fuelled pacifist minds and made it more real for everyone involved. </p>

		<p>Matthew Brady, often credited to be the father of photojournalism, took thousands of photos of the war. Brady even managed to photograph 18 of the 19 presidents at the time. He didn't take all of thos photos himself, of course. He had the help of over 17 paid assistants. After the war, he was in poverty, very much like all other famous artists. During the war, he openly marketed to parents of soldiers for portraits of their children in uniform.</p>
